Sentiment Analysis with BERT
This is a Python project that uses the BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas and NLTK.
Fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model using TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers.
Hyperparameter tuning using scikit-learn.
Deploying the trained model to a web application using Flask.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system, as well as the following packages:

pandas
nltk
tensorflow
transformers
scikit-learn
flask
You can install them using pip, for example:

Copy code
pip install pandas nltk tensorflow transformers scikit-learn flask
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to start the Flask application:
Copy code
python app.py
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000/predict. You should see a form where you can enter some text and get a sentiment prediction from the deployed BERT model.
